### Few smart Notes :-

1) Create a Server.   
Invite Poketwo (USE THIS LINK)
> https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=716390085896962058&scope=bot%20applications.commands&permissions=314432

** Give Poketwo Limited Permissions! (not admin) **

-----

2) Hide poketwo from Extra Channels.

Remove Poketwo Perms(View-Channel) from Channels Used for 
```py
Cmndid,Repeatid,logid. (any other channels if so.)
```

3) Quick View of how the channel should of Server should look:-

Reminder:-     
#catch - for catching & spamming.    
#log - for logging the caught pokemons (private channel - no poketwo allowed)    
#cmnd-order - for using Private commands like $say,$add,$help (private channel - no poketwo allowed)     
#bot-commands - for redirecting the commands used
in #cmnd-order (so no trace)
